Question: 
- If you create a constructor method to build a DVD by title then create a constructor method to build a DVD 
by category. Does JAVA allow you to do this? 

Answer:
- Yes, Java supports constructor overloading, allowing a class to define more than one constructor. 
Each constructor must have a distinct combination of parameters to enable the compiler to select the 
correct one during object creation.
