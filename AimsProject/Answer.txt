Question: 
- Is JAVA a Pass by Value or a Pass by Reference programming language? 

Answer:
- JAVA is a Pass by Value programming language

Question:
- After the call of swap(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD) why does the title of these two objects still remain? 

- After the call of changeTitle(jungleDVD, cinderellaDVD.getTitle()) why is the title of the JungleDVD changed? 

Answer:
- The titles of the two DVDs remain the same because Java is a Pass by Value programming language. When you call swap, the method receives copies of the references to jungleDVD and cinderellaDVD. Inside the method, only these local copies are swapped, not the original references in the main method

- The title of jungleDVD changes because both the parameter dvd inside the method and jungleDVD in main refer to the same object in memory. When the method executes dvd.setTitle(title), it modifies the title of that shared object, so the jungleDVD objectâ€™s title becomes "Cinderella".
